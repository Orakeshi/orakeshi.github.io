# Project Information
This project, titled "The Digital Wishing Tree" was the first project I worked on in my software development career. This saw the in house team at solarflare create an interactive digital wishing tree using a combination of technologies.

In this project I oversaw the majority of development. I worked closely with the integrated designer, Lead creative and CTO. The outcome of this project was that I had gained masses of knowledge in both Unity and coding with C#. This project was extremely beneficial to my learning as a software developer.

Projection Mapping, Nanoleaves & more were used to achieve the final result.

Above is a brief showcase to the complete wishing tree. This is the finished product that we delivered at the end of the SDLC.

# Design:
The wishing tree went through many design iterations. As I was the main developer on the project, I was not heavily involved in regard to the design process. That being said I still had an interest as I was to develop the tree based on the designs provided.
