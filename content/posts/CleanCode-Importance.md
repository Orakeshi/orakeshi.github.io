This blog is about the importance of writing clean and friendly code. The reasoning for this blog post originates from the fact that I have recently completed 2 projects. These projects differ significantly in terms of the way the code was written. As a result, I had a COMPLETELY different experience expanding the codebase for each one.

# Reason For Writing:
As briefly mentioned above, my reasons for writing this article come from the two projects I worked on this month. Without getting into a lot of the specifics, I was tasked with taking two old applications and updating/expanding the functionality of them.

They were two very different applications and had no relation whatsoever. The things they had in common were that they were both developed using unity and bother projects were to be updated within the month of April.

For the sake of this article I will write Project A, which represents the very messy coded application & Project B which had the clean code.
